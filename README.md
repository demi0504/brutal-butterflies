> Popcorn Bucket List is a simple app created with Node.js to serve as a virtual database (a bucketlist) containing movies that the user intends to watch and movies that the user has watched, while also presenting information about these movies. 

**"I love watching movies. It breaks up the monotony of the road and momentarily takes you somewhere else." - Santigold**
